# Introduction to programming - Nolan Sedley

## Welcome welcome welcome!!!
You've just entered a exciting new realm of possibility and learning. With these lessons I hope to teach you the basic building blocks of programming and develop some cool projects along the way. As with all good things this won't be easy but it will be worth it. Near every synthetic item in our world today uses some sort of software. Everyone could stand to benefit from getting familiar with the workings of our rapidly progressing technical world.

## What will we be learning?
The language I've chosen for this course is **JavaScript**. Along with JavaScript you're going to learn a lot more about development, including: 
- Source control
- Command-line interfaces
- Development environments and best practices
- Online resources like Google, stack-overflow and code-pen
- Open-source technology
- and many more subjects of the software world

## Why JavaScript?
*Hold on... a Java-a-whatty?*

Ah yes let me explain what we're tackling here. And I quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): 

>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML 
and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine...

Rather wordy, I agree. Let's start with a simpler definition and revisit this once we have sampled a bit more:
>JavaScript is a programming languague originally engineered to make webpages interactive. Browsers natively support it with a built-in engine that interprets the code as it's run.

 While JavaScript is a high-level language I consider the most approachable due to its popularity and open-source community. When compared to other languages like C++, Java, Listp, and C# getting started in JS is a lot easier. And we all know getting started is half the battle! That said being a programmer is not about knowing one langauge it's about being willing to learn anything. Once you feel very comfortable in JavaScript the world will be your oyster. You can continue to become a JS wizard or easily reach into other interesting languages.

*But I have not interest in developing websites...*

Have no fear. JavaScript is now far more capable that just developing websites. To qoute StackOverflow co-founder Jeff Atwood:

>Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

And with those words we've seen an explosion in the capabilities of what JavaScript can build. Thousands of open-source ventures have thrived in the JS community and support for desktop, plug-in, command-line, web server, mobile and embedded software are easily available. You can't tell me not one of those interests you?
